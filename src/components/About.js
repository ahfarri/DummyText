I found my skills and personality type are a great fit for a successful developer. I love to solve problems and am very analytical, but I also have a creative side that allows me to think outside the box and to find solutions through different angles. My passion for design and creativity led me to a coding bootcamp where I could bring my design skills and analytical experience to create full stack projects in 3 different languages. This is an example of a project in one of those languages. </p>
